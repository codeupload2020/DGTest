# DGTest
1. There are no doubts that many improvements can be done to the project but I have created this with only important configurations. Based on the requirements, more can be implemented if needed.
2. I have implemented a simple Maven project using POM, TestNG and Extent reports.
3. There are different ways to handle a popup but here I just implemented a quickest way and retry analyser will make sure, it will not raise any false alarms.
4. There are many other things can also be implemented such as ability to select different products, different answers to the questions etc. But in this test I just made a simple journey which can be improved in future.
5. There are further validations checks be performed for the value inserted/chosen for questions but again, this also can be implemented based on the requirements.
